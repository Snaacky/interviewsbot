INTERVIEW_QUEUE_EMBED = """You can click the button below to join the queue. Once you are in queue, you will be waiting to be interviewed based on your position in line.

**How long does it take to be interviewed?**
It depends on how many interviewers are available and the amount of people in the queue. While we aim to get through interviews as fast and as often as possible, you may be waiting for an indefinite amount of time.

**How will I know when it's my turn?**
When it is your turn, you will be pinged in the queue channel. There will be a pop up asking you if you are available for an interview. You will have 15 minutes to accept it. If you fail to respond to the ping within 15 minutes, you will be removed from the server.

**What should I do if I need to leave while in queue?**
You can leave the server and rejoin when you have more free time.

**What happens if I have to go in the middle of my interview?**
You will be asked to come back when you have more free time. Failure to complete an interview will not be held against you.

**How can I check what position I am in queue?**
You can check your position by running `/position` in the queue channel.

**Will I lose my position if I leave the server while in queue?**
Yes.

**Can I hang out or idle in the queue?**
No. If you hang out or idle in the interview queue you will be banned from the server.
